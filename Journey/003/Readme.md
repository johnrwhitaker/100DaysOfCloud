# Deploy Azure AD Identity Protection

### Risk Event Detection

Azure AD uses machine learning to detect suspicious actions in our accounts and stores those in a record called a **risk detection**

You can view these risk detections in **Azure AD reporting** and **Azure AD Identity Protection**

There are six different types of risk detections:

- **Users with leaked credentials**
- **Sign-ins from anonymous IP addresses**
- **Impossible travel to atypical locations**
- **Sign-ins from infected devices**
- **Sign-in from unfamiliar locations**
- **Sign-ins from IP addresses with suspicious activity**

You Azure AD subscription determines how much detail you get for each risk detection. If you have an **Azure AD Premium P2 edition** subscription then you get the most detail for risk detections. If you have an **Azure AD Premium P1 edition** subscription then adavanced detections (like unfamiliar sign-in properties) are not covered and will appear under the name Sign-in with _additional risk detected_

You have the option on how you would like to handle risk detections. You can either manually address them or respond to them automatically using Conditional Access policies
